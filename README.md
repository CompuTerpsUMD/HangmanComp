To begin:
1. Choose language:
 - Java: Type "make JAVA_SETUP"
 - C: Type "make C_SETUP"
 - Python: Type "make PYTHON_SETUP"

2. Begin programming in the user_pgm file
 - Although you are free to implement this project however you want. I would reccomend using the functions and methods that I have included. In all of the program files, there is one function or method that gets in the input in some form and another function or method that when run gives the output.

3. Compile program
 - If you are using Java or C, run "make java" or "make c" respectively. If you are using python, skip this step

3. Run code:
 - To run the program, run the command "./handler <NUM LETTERS>" NUM_LETTERS representing the number of letters in the randomly chosen word.

3. Test code:
 - To run a larger test of the system, run "./test.sh" and watch it go.

GOOD LUCK!!! YOU'LL NEED IT!!!
